## Requirements and Installation

I assume you're using these files on a recent linux distribution. You should be good to go, if you install:

 - texlive
 - pandoc

Get the rpg-module package from <https://github.com/slithy/rpg_module>.
You should install it in one of your texmf folders. Running the command texhash should make it available to your texlive installation. 

Finally copy the mdmod folder to a directory where you want to
work on your project.
